# Arduino code for PolyMersion experiments

This folder contains the Arduino code to run the Polymersion experiments with one or two water baths. 

The schematics for running with only one bath are presented in the following figure:

In case of using two water baths, you will need to install a new water level sensor, temperature sensor and add another pump to the free ports in the L289N driver.
