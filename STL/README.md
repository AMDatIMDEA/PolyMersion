# 3D Printing Guide for PolyMersion  

## Overview  
This folder contains the STL files required to fabricate the components for the Polymer Degradation Testing setup. The parts are designed to be printed using standard 3D printers and assembled for the UR10-e Robot Arm experiment.  

## Components to Print  

### Required Pieces:  
- **Base Plate (x1)** – The foundational structure for mounting the grid and supporting the specimens.  
- **Top Plate (x1)** – The upper structural part that holds specimens in place.  
- **Intermediate Trays (x2 or more)** – Adjustable trays that hold the polymer samples during testing.
- Remember that 2 trays are neccesary, one for the water bath and the other one outside.  

### Additional Components:  
- **Screw covers** - To maintain the structure.
- **Tray Connectors** – Connectors are included to join trays if they need to be printed in separate sections.  
- **Complements** – Complementary parts as water level controller, scale adapter and gripper. 

## Printing Instructions  
1. **Print Orientation and Size**:  
   - Ensure that large components are printed flat to minimize warping.
     
2. **Printing in Parts**:  
   - The **STL files** in this directory are pre-sliced into three parts for each layer of the tray to fit standard print beds, such as the Bambu printer.
   - CAD files are included to modify this pre-slicing.
   - Use the **tray connectors** to reassemble parts post-printing.  
   - The STL files for the connectors and joining pieces are provided in this folder.  

3. **Material Recommendation**:  
   - Use **ASA** for structural integrity and resistance to degradation under experimental conditions.  
   - Ensure all components are printed with a minimum of 3 perimeters and 30% infill for durability.  

4. **Post-Processing**:  
   - Light sanding may be required to ensure that connectors and assembled sections fit smoothly.  
   - Test-fit all components before final assembly.  

## Assembly Notes  
- Refer to the CAD models to visualize the complete assembly.  
- Ensure the top and base plates align correctly with the trays and connectors.  
- Tighten all clips and connectors to secure the experiment structure.
- If you encounter any issues during printing or assembly, consider scaling components slightly or adjusting slicing parameters. 

## Files Included  
- **STL Files** – Ready-to-print 3D models.

**Note:**  
If adjustments to the design are required, the CAD folder contains the editable models. Modify them as needed to fit your experimental setup or printer specifications.
